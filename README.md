# hello-world
Hello world. This is my first try at using Github!
I am excited to learn how to use Github. I am building experience in the programming world, I came a little late in the game but I am decided on learning about data analysis and be able to work with it. I hope I get to submit many projects here in Github so I can start bulding a portifolio.
Thanks for reading about me! :)
